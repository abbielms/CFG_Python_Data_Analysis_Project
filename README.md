# CFG_Python_Data_Analysis_Project
 CFG Python Programming - Project
 
 Code First Girls Python Programming intensive course final project. I chose to do my project on data analysis on a CSV file, called 'sales.csv', which contains fake data from a business showing monthly sales and expenditures. This was a collaborative project, where I worked with one other team member and I was the main coder. 
 
 The 'project.py' file is the code from using PyCharm, and the 'project.ipynb' file is the code from using Jupyter Notebook. The file 'salesFinished.csv' is the finished csv file that I created, with all the extra calculations I did using Python. There is also a corresponding Excel file, called 'salesFinished.xlsx'.
